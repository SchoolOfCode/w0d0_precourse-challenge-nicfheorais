    <h2>(with thanks to The Irish Times newspaper for the article)</h2>

    <p>
    Celebrating some of the less well-known stories of women who helped to shape Irish society or contributed to our understanding of the world. Gone but not forgotten.

                (c 451-523) Brigid of Kildare. As a figure of legend and Ireland’s only female patron saint, as well as the goddess of poetry, healing and smithwork in Celtic myth, Brigid  is hardly unrecognised. But we’d argue she hasn’t always been celebrated for the right things. During the 19th century, she was held up as a symbol of divine femininity, while generations of Irish schoolchildren still associate her with reed crosses. But she was much more than that: a powerful Abbess who offered an alternative to the confines of domestic life to up to 14,000 women, a peaceweaver, a fearless negotiator who secured women’s property rights, and freed trafficked women. And she was also reputed to be an expert dairywoman and brewer.

            <li>
                (d. 1451) Margaret O’Carroll of Éile, Co Offaly  was a medieval queen, patron of the arts, road and bridge builder. She organised the 1440s equivalent of Electric Picnic: epic festivals of literature attended by 2,700 people, and described by scholars as “national events of high and singular importance”, earning her the title Margaret the Hospitable. A contemporary scholar noted that she “was the only woman that has made most of preparing highways, and erecting bridges, churches, and mass-books.”

            <li>
                (1767-1849) Maria Edgeworth is often overlooked among the greats of the Irish literary canon, despite being one of the most successful novelists of her generation, with a gift for social observation and dialogue that earned the admiration of Sir Walter Scott and Jane Austen. She was one of the first writers to portray the Irish peasant class as real people, with real stories. During the Famine, by then a tiny creature of almost 80, she went door-to-door in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford, distributing food.

                (1789-1865) Dr James Barry aka Margaret Ann Bulkley held the second-highest medical office in the British Army
                If ever there was a story to offer a tantalising glimpse into what women might have achieved throughout history had they been freed from expectations about gender, it’s the life of Margaret Ann Bulkley, a young Cork woman, who grew up to hold the second highest medical office in the British Army. But she first had to reinvent herself as Dr James Barry.  Bulkley became Barry at 20 at first as a route into university in Edinburgh, and possibly to escape the confines of life as a woman. It worked: Barry’s subsequent progress through the British Army was impressive. Everywhere she worked across the British empire, she brought about improvements to public health, sanitation and nutrition, and performed one of the first C-sections survived by both mother and child. Barry’s secret was revealed after her death, when her instructions that she be buried without an inspection of her body were ignored.

            <li> 
                (1821-1896) Lady Jane Wilde.    Though much less famous in subsequent years than her middle son Oscar, Wexford woman Lady Jane Wilde was a significant figure in 19th-century Ireland: a gifted linguist and poet who published under the name Speranza, a documenter of the Famine, a women’s rights activist, and a nationalist who used her writing to call for insurrection. In 1864, she and her husband Sir William were at the centre of a sensational court case, after they were sued for libel by Mary Travers, who claimed he had seduced her and was awarded £2,000. Within a few years, Wilde would lose her daughter Isola, her husband, her home, their fortune, and see her son Oscar imprisoned.

            <li>
                (1842-1907) Agnes Clerke, from Skibbereen in West Cork, studied stars as a child using her father's telescope. She wrote A Popular History of Astronomy and many year after her death, in 1981, NASA named a moon crater, near Apollo 12's landing spot, in her honour.
            </li>


            <li>
                (1868-1947) Annie Russell Maunder  is the other Irish woman with a crater on the moon named after her. The Tyrone-born woman studied at Cambridge and, though she graduated as the top mathematician of her year, restrictions on women meant she was not awarded a BA. She got a job as a “lady computer” at the Greenwich Royal Observatory, where her job was to photograph the sun, until her forced retirement after her marriage to her colleague, Walter Maunder, in 1895. Her work was widely studied and published – often under her husband’s name. The crater Maunder on the moon is named after her and her husband, as is the Maunder Minimum, the period between 1645 and 1715 when sunspots were rare.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1874-1955) Dr Kathleen Lynn - the inventory of her contributions is long: a medical doctor specialising in opthalmology; a volunteer in the soup kitchens during the 1913 Lockout; medical officer to the Irish Citizen Army (ICA); a campaigner for equal rights for women; and the co-founder with her lifelong partner, the equally fearless Madeleine ffrench-Mullen (and a budget of €70) of St Ultan’s Hospital for Infants. Not only did Lynn not get a thank-you from the founding fathers, “by the time of the Civil War, women such as Lynn, who opposed the Treaty, were being castigated as irrational, extremist and almost deranged,” noted Diarmuid Ferriter, written off as “hysterical young women” who should be at home polishing the brasses. She was elected to the Dáil in the 1923 elections, but did not take her seat.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1874-1963) Not nearly enough is known about Achill Island’s intriguing Eva O’Flaherty, a fashionista, entrepreneur and activist. She was milliner on London’s Sloane Street, an artist’s muse, and later a businesswoman who founded a textile business. She was also the founder of Ireland’s oldest summer school, Scoil Acla. Regular visitors to her home included WB Yeats, Paul Henry and Graham Greene.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1877-1946) Hanna Sheehy Skeffington. Unrelenting campaigner for the equal rights of men and women, founding member of the Irish Women Workers’ Union, and co-founder of the Irish Women’s Franchise League (IWFL). In June 1912, Sheehy Skeffington was one of eight women jailed for smashing the glass windows at Dublin Castle after women were excluded from the franchise of the third Home Rule Bill. She was back in Mountjoy the following year, after assaulting a police officer.  She remained a campaigner for women’s rights and an active nationalist throughout her life.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1878 –1971) Lilian Bland was the first woman in Ireland to build and fly an aircraft, and the world’s first female aviation engineer. Born in England, she grew up in Antrim, where she engaged in such unladylike pursuits as smoking, wearing britches, shooting and  building planes. In August 1910, Bland took her biplane, the Mayfly, some 30 feet off the ground, at which point her father promised to buy her a car if she’d stay on terra firma. Not being a woman to do things by halves, she ended up running Belfast’s first Ford car dealership. After an unsuccessful attempt to ride in the Grand National, she married a cousin, Charles Loftus Bland, and moved to Vancouver with him. She died at the age of 92, reportedly still making waves.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1878-1954) Margaret Elizabeth Cousins, born in Boyle, Co Roscommon,  refused to be hemmed in by boring stereotypes. She was a unionist, Methodist, nationalist, suffragist, medium, campaigning vegetarian and music teacher who refused to give up her job after she got married. She was jailed in both London and Dublin for smashing windows at 10 Downing Street and Dublin Castle in protest at the exclusion of women’s suffrage from the Home Rule Bill. In 1915, she and her husband moved to India where she continued to campaign for women’s rights, and organised the first all-India and all-Asia women’s conferences.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1890-1954) Dorothy Stopford Price was responsible for introducing the BCG vaccination to Ireland. In the early 1920s, she was a dispensary doctor in West Cork, where she offered first-aid classes, and treatment for those hurt during the War of Independence and the Civil War. In 1923, she joined Dr Kathleen Lynn as house surgeon at St Ultan’s. In the 1930s, as TB swept the country, she began importing and testing the BCG vaccine, campaigning for a nationwide programme. This brought her into conflict with John Charles McQuaid, who wanted healthcare to remain under control of the Catholic Church. She was appointed head of the national vaccination programme in 1949. Sadly, she suffered a stroke in 1950.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1892 – 1976) Rosie Hackett was just 18 when she organised a strike of 3,000 workers at Jacobs Biscuits, and co-founded the Irish Women Workers’ Union (IWWU) with Delia Larkin. During the Lockout, she was one of those who set up a soup kitchen. She was later active in the Rising, occupying Stephen’s Green alongside Constance Markievicz and others, and was one of the group responsible for printing off the 1916 Proclamation. She would later recall handing it to James Connolly, still dripping wet. She eventually gave 60 years to the trade union movement, and was one of the people responsible for carving out modern working conditions. Rosie Hackett had a bridge named in her honour in 2014.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1894-1963) Teresa Deevy, a Waterford-born dramatist, nationalist and women’s rights activist, became deaf through illness at the age of 19 but, if anything, that only made Teresa more determined to be heard. In her mid-20s, she began writing and, by 1930, she was staging the first of a series of productions, well-received and often quietly subversive, at the Abbey, and was one of the most prolific and acclaimed female playwrights in the world at that time. She was a critic of Catholicism’s repressive attitude to women and of censorship. When her relationship with the Abbey soured abruptly in 1937, she turned to writing for RTÉ and the BBC – all the more remarkable considering she had lost her hearing before radio arrived in Ireland.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1897-1944) Mainie Jellett remains one of the most significant Irish artists of the 20th century, credited with introducing modernism to Ireland. One of her paintings was displayed, alongside one of a misshapen onion, in The Irish Times under the headline “Two freak pictures”, while other publications denounced her as a dangerous source of foreign notions. But she persevered and, by the 1930s, had developed a hybrid style, her paintings combining cubism, religious art and Celtic design – and they went down better with the public.
            </li>

            <li> 
                (1921-1998) Sybil Connolly  changed the face of Irish fashion, dressing Jackie Kennedy, Julie Andrews and Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s and ’60s. After starting her career with Richard Alan, the Swansea-born Waterford woman was appointed design director at the fashion house Gaston Mallet at just 31. She began introducing Irish fabrics such as linen, tweed, lace and crochet, attracting the attentions of Harper’s Bazaar and Life magazine. She never married, telling the Daily Mail in 1957 that she preferred to buy her own mink and diamonds.

            <li> 
                (1921-2006) Donegal-born Kay McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, who was brought up in Pennsylvania, was one of six women selected in 1940s by the US Army to work on the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. Their task was to calculate trajectories for shells and bullets for soldiers using artillery guns – essentially, these women taught themselves to programme. McNulty was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 1997.
